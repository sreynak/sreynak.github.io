					<h3>Sreynak CHET</h3>
					<p>Sreynak CHET is from Kampong Chhnang province. I graduated from Passerlles Numeriques Cambodia (PNC) in 2013 with concentrated studies in Web Development. I am working at Codingate. As a team leader I bring to Codingate strong skills in problem solving, practical innovation, and a continual drive to improve a coding process to perfection. With a never ending desire to expand upon my skills and keep up-to-date with the latest developments, I am a invaluable team leader. Aside from technical interests, I enjoys the fine arts and seeks to understand the deeper meaning behind works of self-expression. One of my goals for the future is International travel and to help younger students to develop leadership skills and achieve their dreams. </p>
